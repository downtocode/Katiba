## Katiba ya Jamhuri ya Muungano wa Tanzania


The Katiba Project aims to make the constitution of The United Republic of Tanzania easily accessible to everyone. There are three different versions of the constitution planned for this initial phase:

1. [The current/active constitution.](https://github.com/downtocode/Katiba/tree/master/katibas/current)
1. [The Judge Warioba Draft.](https://github.com/downtocode/Katiba/tree/master/katibas/rasimu-1)
2. [The Second Draft.](https://github.com/downtocode/Katiba/tree/master/katibas/rasimu-2)

### A few things to note:

* All constitutions were obtained online from government websites in PDF format.
* Each version is housed in a unique directory within this repository.
* Current support is only available for the Kiswahili versions. English versions will be made available in the future.
* Each repository uses the Jekyll structure. The initial aim is to publish each version of the Katiba on github pages.
* Contributions to the project are welcome and encouraged. To contribute please create a pull request.
* This README will continue to be updated as the project progresses.
